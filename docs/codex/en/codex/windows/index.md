# Windows

Source URL: https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows

The easiest way to use Codex on Windows is to [set up the IDE extension](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide) or [install the CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run it from PowerShell.

When you run Codex natively on Windows, the agent mode uses an experimental Windows sandbox to block filesystem writes outside the working folder and prevent network access without your explicit approval. [Learn more below](https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows#windows-experimental-sandbox).

Instead, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSL2). WSL2 gives you a Linux shell, Unix-style semantics, and tooling that match many tasks that models see in training.

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

### Launch VS Code from inside WSL

For step-by-step instructions, see the [official VS Code WSL tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial).

#### Prerequisites

  * Windows with WSL installed. To install WSL, open PowerShell as an administrator, then run `wsl --install` (Ubuntu is a common choice).
  * VS Code with the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) installed.



#### Open VS Code from a WSL terminal
[code] 
    # From your WSL shell
    cd ~/code/your-project
    code .
[/code]

This opens a WSL remote window, installs the VS Code Server if needed, and ensures integrated terminals run in Linux.

#### Confirm you’re connected to WSL

  * Look for the green status bar that shows `WSL: <distro>`.

  * Integrated terminals should display Linux paths (such as `/home/...`) instead of `C:\`.

  * You can verify with:
[code] echo $WSL_DISTRO_NAME
[/code]

This prints your distribution name.




If you don’t see “WSL: …” in the status bar, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, pick `WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL`, and keep your repository under `/home/...` (not `C:\`) for best performance.

### Use Codex CLI with WSL

Run these commands from an elevated PowerShell or Windows Terminal:
[code] 
    # Install default Linux distribution (like Ubuntu)
    wsl --install
    
    # Start a shell inside Windows Subsystem for Linux
    wsl
[/code]

Then run these commands from your WSL shell:
[code] 
    # https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl
    # Install Node.js in WSL (via nvm)
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
    
    # In a new tab or after exiting and running `wsl` again to install Node.js
    nvm install 22
    
    # Install and run Codex in WSL
    npm i -g @openai/codex
    codex
[/code]

### Working on code inside WSL

  * Working in Windows-mounted paths like `/mnt/c/…` can be slower than working in Windows-native paths. Keep your repositories under your Linux home directory (like `~/code/my-app`) for faster I/O and fewer symlink and permission issues: 
[code]mkdir -p ~/code && cd ~/code
        git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
        cd repo
[/code]

  * If you need Windows access to files, they’re under `\wsl$\Ubuntu\home&lt;user>` in Explorer.



## Windows experimental sandbox

The Windows sandbox support is experimental. How it works:

  * Launches commands inside a restricted token derived from an AppContainer profile.
  * Grants only specifically requested filesystem capabilities by attaching capability security identifiers to that profile.
  * Disables outbound network access by overriding proxy-related environment variables and inserting stub executables for common network tools.



Its primary limitation is that it can’t prevent file writes, deletions, or creations in any directory where the Everyone SID already has write permissions (for example, world-writable folders). When using the Windows sandbox, Codex scans for folders where Everyone has write access and recommends that you remove that access.

### Grant sandbox read access

When a command fails because the Windows sandbox can’t read a directory, use:
[code] 
    /sandbox-add-read-dir C:\absolute\directory\path
[/code]

The path must be an existing absolute directory. After the command succeeds, later commands that run in the sandbox can read that directory during the current session.

### Troubleshooting and FAQ

#### Installed extension, but it’s unresponsive

Your system may be missing C++ development tools, which some native dependencies require:

  * Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload)
  * Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)
  * With `winget`, run `winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e`



Then fully restart VS Code after installation.

#### If it feels slow on large repositories

  * Make sure you’re not working under `/mnt/c`. Move the repository to WSL (for example, `~/code/…`).
  * Increase memory and CPU for WSL if needed; update WSL to the latest version: 
[code]wsl --update
        wsl --shutdown
[/code]




#### VS Code in WSL can’t find `codex`

Verify the binary exists and is on PATH inside WSL:
[code] 
    which codex || echo "codex not found"
[/code]

If the binary isn’t found, install it by [following the instructions](https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows#use-codex-cli-with-wsl) above.
