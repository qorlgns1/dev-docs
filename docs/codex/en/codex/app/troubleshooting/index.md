## Frequently Asked Questions

### Files appear in the side panel that Codex didn’t edit

If your project is inside a Git repository, the review panel automatically shows changes based on your project’s Git state, including changes that Codex didn’t make.

In the review pane, you can switch between staged changes and changes not yet staged, and compare your branch with main.

If you want to see only the changes of your last Codex turn, switch the diff pane to the “Last turn changes” view.

[Learn more about how to use the review pane](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/review).

### Remove a project from the sidebar

To remove a project from the sidebar, hover over the name of your project, click the three dots and choose “Remove.” To restore it, re-add the project using the **Add new project** button next to **Threads** or using

`Cmd`+`O`.

### Find archived threads

Archived threads can be found in the [Settings](codex://settings). When you unarchive a thread it will reappear in the original location of your sidebar.

### Only some threads appear in the sidebar

The sidebar allows filtering of threads depending on the state of a project. If you’re missing threads, check whether you have any filters applied by clicking the filter icon next to the **Threads** label.

### Code doesn’t run on a worktree

Worktrees are created in a different directory and only inherit the files that are checked into Git. Depending on how you manage dependencies and tooling for your project you might have to run some setup scripts on your worktree using a [local environment](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/local-environments). Alternatively you can check out the changes in your regular local project. Check out the [worktrees documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/worktrees) to learn more.

### App doesn’t pick up a teammate’s shared local environment

The local environment configuration must be inside the `.codex` folder at the root of your project. If you are working in a monorepo with more than one project, make sure you open the project in the directory that contains the `.codex` folder.

### Codex asks to access Apple Music

Depending on your task, Codex may need to navigate the file system. Certain directories on macOS, including Music, Downloads, or Desktop, require additional approval from the user. If Codex needs to read your home directory, macOS prompts you to approve access to those folders.

### Automations create many worktrees

Frequent automations can create many worktrees over time. Archive automation runs you no longer need and avoid pinning runs unless you intend to keep their worktrees.

### Recover a prompt after selecting the wrong target

If you started a thread with the wrong target (**Local** , **Worktree** , or **Cloud**) by accident, you can cancel the current run and recover your previous prompt by pressing the up arrow key in the composer.

### Feature is working in the Codex CLI but not in the Codex app

The Codex app and Codex CLI use the same underlying Codex agent and configuration but might rely on different versions of the agent at any time and some experimental features might land in the Codex CLI first.

To get the version of the Codex CLI on your system run:
[code] 
    codex --version
[/code]

To get the version of Codex bundled with your Codex app run:
[code] 
    /Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex --version
[/code]

## Feedback and logs

Type `/` into the message composer to provide feedback for the team. If you trigger feedback in an existing conversation, you can choose to share the existing session along with your feedback. After submitting your feedback, you’ll receive a session ID that you can share with the team.

To report an issue:

  1. Find [existing issues](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues) on the Codex GitHub repo.
  2. [Open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/new?template=2-bug-report.yml&steps=Uploaded%20thread%3A%20019c0d37-d2b6-74c0-918f-0e64af9b6e14)



More logs are available in the following locations:

  * App logs (macOS): `~/Library/Logs/com.openai.codex/YYYY/MM/DD`
  * Session transcripts: `$CODEX_HOME/sessions` (default: `~/.codex/sessions`)
  * Archived sessions: `$CODEX_HOME/archived_sessions` (default: `~/.codex/archived_sessions`)



If you share logs, review them first to confirm they don’t contain sensitive information.

## Stuck states and recovery patterns

If a thread appears stuck:

  1. Check whether Codex is waiting for an approval.
  2. Open the terminal and run a basic command like `git status`.
  3. Start a new thread with a smaller, more focused prompt.



If you cancel worktree creation by mistake and lose your prompt, press the up arrow key in the composer to recover it.

## Terminal issues

**Terminal appears stuck**

  1. Close the terminal panel.
  2. Reopen it with `Cmd`+`J`.
  3. Re-run a basic command like `pwd` or `git status`.



If commands behave differently than expected, validate the current directory and branch in the terminal first.

If it continues to be stuck, wait until your active Codex threads are completed and restart the app.

**Fonts aren’t rendering correctly**

Codex uses the same font for the review pane, integrated terminal and any other code displayed inside the app. You can configure the font inside the [Settings](codex://settings) pane as **Code font**.
