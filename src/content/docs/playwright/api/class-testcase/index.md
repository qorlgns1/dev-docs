# TestCase | Playwright

`TestCase` corresponds to every [test()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-call) call in a test file. When a single [test()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-call) is running in multiple projects or repeated multiple times, it will have multiple `TestCase` objects in corresponding projects' suites.
