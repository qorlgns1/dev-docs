# Tracing | Playwright

API for collecting and saving Playwright traces. Playwright traces can be opened in [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) after Playwright script runs.

note

You probably want to [enable tracing in your config file](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-trace) instead of using `context.tracing`.

The `context.tracing` API captures browser operations and network activity, but it doesn't record test assertions (like `expect` calls). We recommend [enabling tracing through Playwright Test configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-trace), which includes those assertions and provides a more complete trace for debugging test failures.

Start recording a trace before performing actions. At the end, stop tracing and save it to a file.

```
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const context = await browser.newContext();
    await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });
    const page = await context.newPage();
    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
    expect(page.url()).toBe('https://playwright.dev');
    await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });

```

## Methods[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### group[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-group "Direct link to group")

Added in: v1.49 tracing.group

caution

Use `test.step` instead when available.

Creates a new group within the trace, assigning any subsequent API calls to this group, until [tracing.groupEnd()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-group-end) is called. Groups can be nested and will be visible in the trace viewer.

**Usage**

```
    // use test.step instead
    await test.step('Log in', async () => {
      // ...
    });

```

**Arguments**

### start[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start "Direct link to start")

Added in: v1.12 tracing.start

Start tracing.

note

You probably want to [enable tracing in your config file](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-trace) instead of using `Tracing.start`.

The `context.tracing` API captures browser operations and network activity, but it doesn't record test assertions (like `expect` calls). We recommend [enabling tracing through Playwright Test configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-trace), which includes those assertions and provides a more complete trace for debugging test failures.

**Usage**

```
    await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });
    const page = await context.newPage();
    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
    expect(page.url()).toBe('https://playwright.dev');
    await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });

```

**Arguments**

If specified, intermediate trace files are going to be saved into the files with the given name prefix inside the [tracesDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-option-traces-dir) directory specified in [browserType.launch()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch). To specify the final trace zip file name, you need to pass `path` option to [tracing.stop()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop) instead.

    * `screenshots` [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type "Boolean") _(optional)_[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-screenshots)

Whether to capture screenshots during tracing. Screenshots are used to build a timeline preview.

      * capture DOM snapshot on every action
      * record network activity

    await context.tracing.stopChunk({ path: 'trace1.zip' });

    await context.tracing.startChunk();
    await page.goto('http://example.com');
    // Save a second trace file with different actions.
