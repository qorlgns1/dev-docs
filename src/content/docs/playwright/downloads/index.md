## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/downloads#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

For every attachment downloaded by the page, [page.on('download')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-event-download) event is emitted. All these attachments are downloaded into a temporary folder. You can obtain the download url, file name and payload stream using the [Download](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-download "Download") object from the event.

You can specify where to persist downloaded files using the [downloadsPath](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-option-downloads-path) option in [browserType.launch()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch).

note

Downloaded files are deleted when the browser context that produced them is closed.

Here is the simplest way to handle the file download:

```
    // Start waiting for download before clicking. Note no await.
    const downloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
    await page.getByText('Download file').click();
    const download = await downloadPromise;

    // Wait for the download process to complete and save the downloaded file somewhere.
    await download.saveAs('/path/to/save/at/' + download.suggestedFilename());

```

#### Variations[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/downloads#variations "Direct link to Variations")

If you have no idea what initiates the download, you can still handle the event:

```
    page.on('download', download => download.path().then(console.log));

```

Note that handling the event forks the control flow and makes the script harder to follow. Your scenario might end while you are downloading a file since your main control flow is not awaiting for this operation to resolve.

note

For uploading files, see the [uploading files](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#upload-files) section.
