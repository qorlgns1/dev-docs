# No Cache Detected

## Why This Error Occurred

A Next.js build was triggered in a continuous integration environment, but no cache was detected.

This results in slower builds and can hurt Next.js' filesystem cache of client-side bundles across builds.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

> **Note**: If this is a new project, or being built for the first time in your CI, you can ignore this error.
> However, you'll want to make sure it doesn't continue to happen and fix it if it does!

Follow the instructions in [CI Build Caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/ci-build-caching) to ensure your Next.js cache is persisted between builds.
