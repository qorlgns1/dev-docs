# Routing

The Pages Router has a file-system based router built on concepts of pages. When a file is added to the `pages` directory it's automatically available as a route. Learn more about routing in the Pages Router:

- [Pages and Layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts)
  - Create your first page and shared layout with the Pages Router.
- [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)
  - Dynamic Routes are pages that allow you to add custom params to your URLs. Start creating Dynamic Routes and learn more here.
- [Linking and Navigating](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating)
  - Learn how navigation works in Next.js, and how to use the Link Component and `useRouter` hook.
- [Custom App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app)
  - Control page initialization and add a layout that persists for all pages by overriding the default App component used by Next.js.
- [Custom Document](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document)
  - Extend the default document markup added by Next.js.
- [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)
