# Create a new Next.js application

Last updated February 20, 2026

## System requirements[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#system-requirements)

Before you begin, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

  * Minimum Node.js version: [20.9](https://nodejs.org/)
  * Operating systems: macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux.



## Supported browsers[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#supported-browsers)

Next.js supports modern browsers with zero configuration.

  * Chrome 111+
  * Edge 111+
  * Firefox 111+
  * Safari 16.4+



Learn more about [browser support](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/supported-browsers), including how to configure polyfills and target specific browsers.

## Create with the CLI[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#create-with-the-cli)

The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

pnpmnpmyarnbun

Terminal
[code]
    pnpm create next-app
[/code]

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

Terminal
[code]
    What is your project named? my-app
    Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults?
        Yes, use recommended defaults - TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, Turbopack
        No, reuse previous settings
        No, customize settings - Choose your own preferences
[/code]

If you choose to `customize settings`, you'll see the following prompts:

Terminal
[code]
    Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
    Which linter would you like to use? ESLint / Biome / None
    Would you like to use React Compiler? No / Yes
    Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
    Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
    Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
    Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
    What import alias would you like configured? @/*
[/code]

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual installation[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#manual-installation)

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

pnpmnpmyarnbun

Terminal
[code]
    pnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
[/code]

> **Good to know** : The App Router uses [React canary releases](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries) built-in, which include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks. The Pages Router uses the React version you install in `package.json`.

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

package.json
[code]
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "eslint",
        "lint:fix": "eslint --fix"
      }
    }
[/code]

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

  * `next dev`: Starts the development server using Turbopack (default bundler).
  * `next build`: Builds the application for production.
  * `next start`: Starts the production server.
  * `eslint`: Runs ESLint.



Turbopack is now the default bundler. To use Webpack run `next dev --webpack` or `next build --webpack`. See the [Turbopack docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack) for configuration details.

### Create the `pages` directory[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#create-the-pages-directory)

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

Create a `pages` directory at the root of your project. Then, add an `index.tsx` file inside your `pages` folder. This will be your home page (`/`):

pages/index.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    export default function Page() {
      return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
    }
[/code]

Next, add an `_app.tsx` file inside `pages/` to define the global layout. Learn more about the [custom App file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app).

pages/_app.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
     
    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }
[/code]

Finally, add a `_document.tsx` file inside `pages/` to control the initial response from the server. Learn more about the [custom Document file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document).

pages/_document.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
     
    export default function Document() {
      return (
        <Html>
          <Head />
          <body>
            <Main />
            <NextScript />
          </body>
        </Html>
      )
    }
[/code]

### Create the `public` folder (optional)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#create-the-public-folder-optional)

Create a [`public` folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

You can then reference these assets using the root path (`/`). For example, `public/profile.png` can be referenced as `/profile.png`:

app/page.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    import Image from 'next/image'
     
    export default function Page() {
      return <Image src="/profile.png" alt="Profile" width={100} height={100} />
    }
[/code]

## Run the development server[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#run-the-development-server)

  1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
  2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
  3. Edit the `pages/index.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.



## Set up TypeScript[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#set-up-typescript)

> Minimum TypeScript version: `v5.1.0`

Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to `.ts` / `.tsx` and run `next dev`. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.

See the [TypeScript reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/typescript) page for more information.

## Set up linting[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#set-up-linting)

Next.js supports linting with either ESLint or Biome. Choose a linter and run it directly via `package.json` scripts.

  * Use **ESLint** (comprehensive rules):



package.json
[code]
    {
      "scripts": {
        "lint": "eslint",
        "lint:fix": "eslint --fix"
      }
    }
[/code]

  * Or use **Biome** (fast linter + formatter):



package.json
[code]
    {
      "scripts": {
        "lint": "biome check",
        "format": "biome format --write"
      }
    }
[/code]

If your project previously used `next lint`, migrate your scripts to the ESLint CLI with the codemod:

Terminal
[code]
    npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .
[/code]

If you use ESLint, create an explicit config (recommended `eslint.config.mjs`). ESLint supports both [the legacy `.eslintrc.*` and the newer `eslint.config.mjs` formats](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#configuring-eslint). See the [ESLint API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#with-core-web-vitals) for a recommended setup.

> **Good to know** : Starting with Next.js 16, `next build` no longer runs the linter automatically. Instead, you can run your linter through NPM scripts.

See the [ESLint Plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint) page for more information.

## Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases[](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation#set-up-absolute-imports-and-module-path-aliases)

Next.js has in-built support for the `"paths"` and `"baseUrl"` options of `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` files.

These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:
[code] 
    // Before
    import { Button } from '../../../components/button'
     
    // After
    import { Button } from '@/components/button'
[/code]

To configure absolute imports, add the `baseUrl` configuration option to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. For example:

tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json
[code]
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "src/"
      }
    }
[/code]

In addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `"paths"` option to `"alias"` module paths.

For example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:

tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json
[code]
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "src/",
        "paths": {
          "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
          "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
        }
      }
    }
[/code]

Each of the `"paths"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location.
