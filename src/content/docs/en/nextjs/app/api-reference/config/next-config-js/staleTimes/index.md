# staleTimes

> This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it is not recommended for production.

`staleTimes` is an experimental feature that enables caching of page segments in the [client-side router cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#client-side-router-cache).

You can enable this experimental feature and provide custom revalidation times by setting the experimental `staleTimes` flag:

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
      static: 180,
    },
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

The `static` and `dynamic` properties correspond with the time period (in seconds) based on different types of [link prefetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link#prefetch).

* The `dynamic` property is used when the page is neither statically generated nor fully prefetched (e.g. with `prefetch={true}`).
  * Default: 0 seconds (not cached)
* The `static` property is used for statically generated pages, or when the `prefetch` prop on `Link` is set to `true`, or when calling [`router.prefetch`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#routerprefetch).
  * Default: 5 minutes

> **Good to know:**
>
> * [Loading boundaries](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) are considered reusable for the `static` period defined in this configuration.
> * This doesn't affect [partial rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#client-side-transitions), **meaning shared layouts won't automatically be refetched on every navigation, only the page segment that changes.**
> * This doesn't change [back/forward caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching#client-side-router-cache) behavior to prevent layout shift and to prevent losing the browser scroll position.
