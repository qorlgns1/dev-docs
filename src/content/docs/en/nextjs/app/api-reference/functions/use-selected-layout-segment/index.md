# useSelectedLayoutSegment

Last updated February 20, 2026

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` is a **Client Component** hook that lets you read the active route segment **one level below** the Layout it is called from.

It is useful for navigation UI, such as tabs inside a parent layout that change style depending on the active child segment.

app/example-client-component.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    'use client'
     
    import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'
     
    export default function ExampleClientComponent() {
      const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment()
     
      return <p>Active segment: {segment}</p>
    }
[/code]

> **Good to know** :
> 
>   * Since `useSelectedLayoutSegment` is a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) hook, and Layouts are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) by default, `useSelectedLayoutSegment` is usually called via a Client Component that is imported into a Layout.
>   * `useSelectedLayoutSegment` only returns the segment one level down. To return all active segments, see [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments)
>   * For [catch-all](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) routes, the matched segments are returned as a single joined string. For example, given `app/blog/[...slug]/page.js`, calling from `app/blog/layout.js` when visiting `/blog/a/b/c` returns `'a/b/c'`.

## Parameters[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment#parameters)
[code] 
    const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment(parallelRoutesKey?: string)
[/code]

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` _optionally_ accepts a [`parallelRoutesKey`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#with-useselectedlayoutsegments), which allows you to read the active route segment within that slot.

## Returns[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment#returns)

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` returns a string of the active segment or `null` if one doesn't exist.

For example, given the Layouts and URLs below, the returned segment would be:

Layout| Visited URL| Returned Segment  
---|---|---  
`app/layout.js`| `/`| `null`  
`app/layout.js`| `/dashboard`| `'dashboard'`  
`app/dashboard/layout.js`| `/dashboard`| `null`  
`app/dashboard/layout.js`| `/dashboard/settings`| `'settings'`  
`app/dashboard/layout.js`| `/dashboard/analytics`| `'analytics'`  
`app/dashboard/layout.js`| `/dashboard/analytics/monthly`| `'analytics'`  
  
For catch-all routes (`[...slug]`), the returned segment contains all matched path segments joined as a single string:

Layout| Visited URL| Returned Segment  
---|---|---  
`app/blog/layout.js`| `/blog/a/b/c`| `'a/b/c'`

### Creating an active link component[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment#creating-an-active-link-component)

You can use `useSelectedLayoutSegment` to create an active link component that changes style depending on the active segment. For example, a featured posts list in the sidebar of a blog:

app/blog/blog-nav-link.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    'use client'
     
    import Link from 'next/link'
    import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'
     
    // This *client* component will be imported into a blog layout
    export default function BlogNavLink({
      slug,
      children,
    }: {
      slug: string
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      // Navigating to `/blog/hello-world` will return 'hello-world'
      // for the selected layout segment
      const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment()
      const isActive = slug === segment
     
      return (
        <Link
          href={`/blog/${slug}`}
          // Change style depending on whether the link is active
          style={{ fontWeight: isActive ? 'bold' : 'normal' }}
        >
          {children}
        </Link>
      )
    }
[/code]

app/blog/layout.tsx

JavaScriptTypeScript
[code]
    // Import the Client Component into a parent Layout (Server Component)
    import { BlogNavLink } from './blog-nav-link'
    import getFeaturedPosts from './get-featured-posts'
     
    export default async function Layout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      const featuredPosts = await getFeaturedPosts()
      return (
        <div>
          {featuredPosts.map((post) => (
            <div key={post.id}>
              <BlogNavLink slug={post.slug}>{post.title}</BlogNavLink>
            </div>
          ))}
          <div>{children}</div>
        </div>
      )
    }
[/code]
