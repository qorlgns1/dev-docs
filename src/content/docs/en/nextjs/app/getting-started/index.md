# Getting Started

Last updated February 20, 2026

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

This **Getting Started** section will help you create your first Next.js app and learn the core features you'll use in every project.

## Pre-requisite knowledge[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started#pre-requisite-knowledge)

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * React



If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our [React Foundations course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations), and the [Next.js Foundations course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) that has you building an application as you learn.
