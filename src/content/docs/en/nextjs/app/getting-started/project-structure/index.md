# Project structure and organization

Last updated February 20, 2026

This page provides an overview of **all** the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

## Folder and file conventions[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#folder-and-file-conventions)

### Top-level folders[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#top-level-folders)

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

|   
---|---  
[`app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)| App Router  
[`pages`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing)| Pages Router  
[`public`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder)| Static assets to be served  
[`src`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder)| Optional application source folder  
  
### Top-level files[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#top-level-files)

Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run proxy, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

|   
---|---  
**Next.js**|   
[`next.config.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js)| Configuration file for Next.js  
[`package.json`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation#manual-installation)| Project dependencies and scripts

### Routing Files[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files)

Add `page` to expose a route, `layout` for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, `loading` for skeletons, `error` for error boundaries, and `route` for APIs.

| |   
---|---|---  
[`layout`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Layout  
[`page`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Page  
[`loading`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Loading UI  
[`not-found`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Not found UI  
[`error`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Error UI  
[`global-error`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error#global-error)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Global error UI  
[`route`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route)| `.js` `.ts`| API endpoint  
[`template`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/template)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Re-rendered layout  
[`default`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Parallel route fallback page  
  
### Nested routes[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#nested-routes)

Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a `page` or `route` file exists.

Path| URL pattern| Notes  
---|---|---  
`app/layout.tsx`| —| Root layout wraps all routes  
`app/blog/layout.tsx`| —| Wraps `/blog` and descendants  
`app/page.tsx`| `/`| Public route  
`app/blog/page.tsx`| `/blog`| Public route  
`app/blog/authors/page.tsx`| `/blog/authors`| Public route  
  
### Dynamic routes[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#dynamic-routes)

Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use `[segment]` for a single param, `[...segment]` for catch‑all, and `[[...segment]]` for optional catch‑all. Access values via the [`params`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop.

Path| URL pattern  
---|---  
`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`| `/blog/my-first-post`  
`app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx`| `/shop/clothing`, `/shop/clothing/shirts`  
`app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`| `/docs`, `/docs/layouts-and-pages`, `/docs/api-reference/use-router`  
  
### Route groups and private folders[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#route-groups-and-private-folders)

Organize code without changing URLs with route groups [`(group)`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-groups#convention), and colocate non-routable files with private folders [`_folder`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#private-folders).

Path| URL pattern| Notes  
---|---|---  
`app/(marketing)/page.tsx`| `/`| Group omitted from URL  
`app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`| `/cart`| Share layouts within `(shop)`  
`app/blog/_components/Post.tsx`| —| Not routable; safe place for UI utilities  
`app/blog/_lib/data.ts`| —| Not routable; safe place for utils  
  
### Parallel and Intercepted Routes[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#parallel-and-intercepted-routes)

These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.

Use `@slot` for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.

Pattern (docs)| Meaning| Typical use case  
---|---|---  
[`@folder`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#slots)| Named slot| Sidebar + main content  
[`(.)folder`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept same level| Preview sibling route in a modal  
[`(..)folder`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept parent| Open a child of the parent as an overlay  
[`(..)(..)folder`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept two levels| Deeply nested overlay  
[`(...)folder`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept from root| Show arbitrary route in current view

## Organizing your project[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#organizing-your-project)

Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

### Component hierarchy[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#component-hierarchy)

The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

  * `layout.js`
  * `template.js`
  * `error.js` (React error boundary)
  * `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
  * `not-found.js` (React error boundary for "not found" UI)
  * `page.js` or nested `layout.js`



The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

### Colocation[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#colocation)

In the `app` directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.

This means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.

> **Good to know** : While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can [keep them outside the `app` directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#store-project-files-outside-of-app).

### Private folders[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#private-folders)

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

Since files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#colocation), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

  * Separating UI logic from routing logic.
  * Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
  * Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
  * Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.



> **Good to know** :
> 
>   * While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
>   * You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
>   * If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.
> 


### Route groups[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#route-groups)

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

Route groups are useful for:

  * Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
  * Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
    * [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
    * [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)



### `src` folder[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#src-folder)

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

## Examples[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#examples)

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know** : In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### Store project files outside of `app`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#store-project-files-outside-of-app)

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

### Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#store-project-files-in-top-level-folders-inside-of-app)

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the`app` directory**.

### Split project files by feature or route[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#split-project-files-by-feature-or-route)

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

### Organize routes without affecting the URL path[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#organize-routes-without-affecting-the-url-path)

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

### Opting specific segments into a layout[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

### Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#opting-for-loading-skeletons-on-a-specific-route)

To apply a [loading skeleton](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) via a `loading.js` file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., `/(overview)`) and then move your `loading.tsx` inside that route group.

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

### Creating multiple root layouts[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#creating-multiple-root-layouts)

To create multiple [root layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.
