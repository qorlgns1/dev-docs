# Slash commands in Codex CLI

Source URL: https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands

Slash commands give you fast, keyboard-first control over Codex. Type `/` in the composer to open the slash popup, choose a command, and Codex will perform actions such as switching models, adjusting permissions, or summarizing long conversations without leaving the terminal.

This guide shows you how to:

  * Find the right built-in slash command for a task
  * Steer an active session with commands like `/model`, `/personality`, `/permissions`, `/experimental`, `/agent`, and `/status`



## Built-in slash commands

Codex ships with the following commands. Open the slash popup and start typing the command name to filter the list.

Command| Purpose| When to use it  
---|---|---  
[`/permissions`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#update-permissions-with-permissions)| Set what Codex can do without asking first.| Relax or tighten approval requirements mid-session, such as switching between Auto and Read Only.  
[`/sandbox-add-read-dir`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#grant-sandbox-read-access-with-sandbox-add-read-dir)| Grant sandbox read access to an extra directory (Windows only).| Unblock commands that need to read an absolute directory path outside the current readable roots.  
[`/agent`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#switch-agent-threads-with-agent)| Switch the active agent thread.| Inspect or continue work in a spawned sub-agent thread.  
[`/apps`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#browse-apps-with-apps)| Browse apps (connectors) and insert them into your prompt.| Attach an app as `$app-slug` before asking Codex to use it.  
[`/compact`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#keep-transcripts-lean-with-compact)| Summarize the visible conversation to free tokens.| Use after long runs so Codex retains key points without blowing the context window.  
[`/diff`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#review-changes-with-diff)| Show the Git diff, including files Git isn’t tracking yet.| Review Codex’s edits before you commit or run tests.  
[`/exit`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#exit-the-cli-with-quit-or-exit)| Exit the CLI (same as `/quit`).| Alternative spelling; both commands exit the session.  
[`/experimental`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#toggle-experimental-features-with-experimental)| Toggle experimental features.| Enable optional features such as sub-agents from the CLI.  
[`/feedback`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#send-feedback-with-feedback)| Send logs to the Codex maintainers.| Report issues or share diagnostics with support.

[`/mcp`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#list-mcp-tools-with-mcp)| List configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.| Check which external tools Codex can call during the session.  
[`/mention`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#highlight-files-with-mention)| Attach a file to the conversation.| Point Codex at specific files or folders you want it to inspect next.  
[`/model`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#set-the-active-model-with-model)| Choose the active model (and reasoning effort, when available).| Switch between general-purpose models (`gpt-4.1-mini`) and deeper reasoning models before running a task.  
[`/plan`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#switch-to-plan-mode-with-plan)| Switch to plan mode and optionally send a prompt.| Ask Codex to propose an execution plan before implementation work starts.  
[`/personality`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#set-a-communication-style-with-personality)| Choose a communication style for responses.| Make Codex more concise, more explanatory, or more collaborative without changing your instructions.  
[`/ps`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#check-background-terminals-with-ps)| Show experimental background terminals and their recent output.| Check long-running commands without leaving the main transcript.  
[`/fork`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#fork-the-current-conversation-with-fork)| Fork the current conversation into a new thread.| Branch the active session to explore a new approach without losing the current transcript.

[`/new`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#start-a-new-conversation-with-new)| Start a new conversation inside the same CLI session.| Reset the chat context without leaving the CLI when you want a fresh prompt in the same repo.  
[`/quit`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#exit-the-cli-with-quit-or-exit)| Exit the CLI.| Leave the session immediately.  
[`/review`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#ask-for-a-working-tree-review-with-review)| Ask Codex to review your working tree.| Run after Codex completes work or when you want a second set of eyes on local changes.  
[`/status`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands#inspect-the-session-with-status)| Display session configuration and token usage.| Confirm the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and remaining context capacity.

`/quit` and `/exit` both exit the CLI. Use them only after you have saved or committed any important work.

The `/approvals` command still works as an alias, but it no longer appears in the slash popup list.

## Control your session with slash commands

The following workflows keep your session on track without restarting Codex.

### Set the active model with `/model`

  1. Start Codex and open the composer.
  2. Type `/model` and press Enter.
  3. Choose a model such as `gpt-4.1-mini` or `gpt-4.1` from the popup.



Expected: Codex confirms the new model in the transcript. Run `/status` to verify the change.

### Set a communication style with `/personality`

Use `/personality` to change how Codex communicates without rewriting your prompt.

  1. In an active conversation, type `/personality` and press Enter.
  2. Choose a style from the popup.



Expected: Codex confirms the new style in the transcript and uses it for later responses in the thread.

Codex supports `friendly`, `pragmatic`, and `none` personalities. Use `none` to disable personality instructions.

If the active model doesn’t support personality-specific instructions, Codex hides this command.

### Switch to plan mode with `/plan`

  1. Type `/plan` and press Enter to switch the active conversation into plan mode.
  2. Optional: provide inline prompt text (for example, `/plan Propose a migration plan for this service`).
  3. You can paste content or attach images while using inline `/plan` arguments.



Expected: Codex enters plan mode and uses your optional inline prompt as the first planning request.

While a task is already running, `/plan` is temporarily unavailable.

### Toggle experimental features with `/experimental`

  1. Type `/experimental` and press Enter.
  2. Toggle the features you want (for example, **Multi-agents**), then restart Codex.



Expected: Codex saves your feature choices to config and applies them on restart.

### Update permissions with `/permissions`

  1. Type `/permissions` and press Enter.
  2. Select the approval preset that matches your comfort level, for example `Auto` for hands-off runs or `Read Only` to review edits.



Expected: Codex announces the updated policy. Future actions respect the new approval mode until you change it again.

### Grant sandbox read access with `/sandbox-add-read-dir`

This command is available only when running the CLI natively on Windows.

  1. Type `/sandbox-add-read-dir C:\absolute\directory\path` and press Enter.
  2. Confirm the path is an existing absolute directory.



Expected: Codex refreshes the Windows sandbox policy and grants read access to that directory for later commands that run in the sandbox.

### Inspect the session with `/status`

  1. In any conversation, type `/status`.
  2. Review the output for the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and current token usage.



Expected: You see a summary like what `codex status` prints in the shell, confirming Codex is operating where you expect.

### Inspect config layers with `/debug-config`

  1. Type `/debug-config`.
  2. Review the output for config layer order (lowest precedence first), on/off state, and policy sources.



Expected: Codex prints layer diagnostics plus policy details such as `allowed_approval_policies`, `allowed_sandbox_modes`, `mcp_servers`, `rules`, `enforce_residency`, and `experimental_network` when configured.

Use this output to debug why an effective setting differs from `config.toml`.

### Configure footer items with `/statusline`

  1. Type `/statusline`.
  2. Use the picker to toggle and reorder items, then confirm.



Expected: The footer status line updates immediately and persists to `tui.status_line` in `config.toml`.

Available status-line items include model, model+reasoning, context stats, rate limits, git branch, token counters, session id, current directory/project root, and Codex version.

### Check background terminals with `/ps`

  1. Type `/ps`.
  2. Review the list of background terminals and their status.



Expected: Codex shows each background terminal’s command plus up to three recent, non-empty output lines so you can gauge progress at a glance.

Background terminals appear when `unified_exec` is in use; otherwise, the list may be empty.

### Keep transcripts lean with `/compact`

  1. After a long exchange, type `/compact`.
  2. Confirm when Codex offers to summarize the conversation so far.



Expected: Codex replaces earlier turns with a concise summary, freeing context while keeping critical details.

### Review changes with `/diff`

  1. Type `/diff` to inspect the Git diff.
  2. Scroll through the output inside the CLI to review edits and added files.



Expected: Codex shows changes you’ve staged, changes you haven’t staged yet, and files Git hasn’t started tracking, so you can decide what to keep.

### Highlight files with `/mention`

  1. Type `/mention` followed by a path, for example `/mention src/lib/api.ts`.
  2. Select the matching result from the popup.



Expected: Codex adds the file to the conversation, ensuring follow-up turns reference it directly.

### Start a new conversation with `/new`

  1. Type `/new` and press Enter.



Expected: Codex starts a fresh conversation in the same CLI session, so you can switch tasks without leaving your terminal.

### Resume a saved conversation with `/resume`

  1. Type `/resume` and press Enter.
  2. Choose the session you want from the saved-session picker.



Expected: Codex reloads the selected conversation’s transcript so you can pick up where you left off, keeping the original history intact.

### Fork the current conversation with `/fork`

  1. Type `/fork` and press Enter.



Expected: Codex clones the current conversation into a new thread with a fresh ID, leaving the original transcript untouched so you can explore an alternative approach in parallel.

If you need to fork a saved session instead of the current one, run `codex fork` in your terminal to open the session picker.

### Generate `AGENTS.md` with `/init`

  1. Run `/init` in the directory where you want Codex to look for persistent instructions.
  2. Review the generated `AGENTS.md`, then edit it to match your repository conventions.



Expected: Codex creates an `AGENTS.md` scaffold you can refine and commit for future sessions.

### Ask for a working tree review with `/review`

  1. Type `/review`.
  2. Follow up with `/diff` if you want to inspect the exact file changes.



Expected: Codex summarizes issues it finds in your working tree, focusing on behavior changes and missing tests. It uses the current session model unless you set `review_model` in `config.toml`.

### List MCP tools with `/mcp`

  1. Type `/mcp`.
  2. Review the list to confirm which MCP servers and tools are available.



Expected: You see the configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools Codex can call in this session.

### Browse apps with `/apps`

  1. Type `/apps`.
  2. Pick an app from the list.



Expected: Codex inserts the app mention into the composer as `$app-slug`, so you can immediately ask Codex to use it.

### Switch agent threads with `/agent`

  1. Type `/agent` and press Enter.
  2. Select the thread you want from the picker.



Expected: Codex switches the active thread so you can inspect or continue that agent’s work.

### Send feedback with `/feedback`

  1. Type `/feedback` and press Enter.
  2. Follow the prompts to include logs or diagnostics.



Expected: Codex collects the requested diagnostics and submits them to the maintainers.

### Sign out with `/logout`

  1. Type `/logout` and press Enter.



Expected: Codex clears local credentials for the current user session.

### Exit the CLI with `/quit` or `/exit`

  1. Type `/quit` (or `/exit`) and press Enter.



Expected: Codex exits immediately. Save or commit any important work first.
