# Codex Ambassadors

Codex is rapidly becoming one of the most powerful ways to build, driven by builders who share real-world workflows and lessons with each other.

Codex Ambassadors are community organizers, open-source maintainers, student leaders, and power users who actively spread what works, make Codex easier to adopt in practice, and help shape where it goes next.

[ Apply Today ](https://openai.com/form/codex-ambassadors)

[ Upcoming Meetups ](https://developers.openai.com/codex/community/meetups)

Ambassadors run hands-on meetups, workshops, and community sessions around the world.

## What you’ll do

As a Codex Ambassador, you’ll join a small global cohort and partner with OpenAI to:

  * Run hands-on Codex events in your local community
  * Create reusable learning assets others can build on
  * Experiment with ideas to grow and support builder communities
  * Share candid, real-world feedback directly with the Codex team

## Who should apply

We’re looking for people with hands-on experience leading or supporting developer communities, like running meetups, maintaining open-source projects, teaching workshops, or regularly helping others learn how to build.

## Support from OpenAI

  * Codex credits to support your own work and power local events
  * Ready-to-use starter kits you can tailor to your community
  * A direct line to fellow Ambassadors and the Codex team for collaboration and feedback
  * Invitations to future exclusive events where you can meet the Codex team
  * Exclusive swag and a honorarium for your time and contributions

This is a two-way program, and will also evolve our support based on what the cohort learns on the ground.

**Time commitment:** ~2–4 hours per week

## Bring your community with you

If you like bringing people together to build, learn, and share, and you're excited to help shape what a great ambassador program can be, we'd love to hear from you.
