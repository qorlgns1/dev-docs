## Slash commands

Slash commands let you control Codex without leaving the thread composer. Available commands vary based on your environment and access.

### Use a slash command

  1. In the thread composer, type `/`.
  2. Select a command from the list, or keep typing to filter (for example, `/status`).



You can also explicitly invoke skills by typing `$` in the thread composer. See [Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

Enabled skills also appear in the slash command list (for example, `/imagegen`).

### Available slash commands

Slash command| Description  
---|---  
`/feedback`| Open the feedback dialog to submit feedback and optionally include logs.  
`/mcp`| Open MCP status to view connected servers.  
`/plan-mode`| Toggle plan mode for multi-step planning.  
`/review`| Start code review mode to review uncommitted changes or compare against a base branch.  
`/status`| Show the thread ID, context usage, and rate limits.
