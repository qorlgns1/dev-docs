# Codex app

The Codex app is a focused desktop experience for working on Codex threads in parallel, with built-in worktree support, automations, and Git functionality.

ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans include Codex. Learn more about [what's included](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing).

## Getting started

The Codex app is available on macOS (Apple Silicon).

1. Download and install the Codex app

    The Codex app is currently only available for macOS.

[Download for macOS](https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex.dmg)

      [Get notified for Windows and Linux](https://openai.com/form/codex-app/)

2. Open Codex and sign in

   Once you downloaded and installed the Codex app, open it and sign in with your ChatGPT account or an OpenAI API key.

   If you sign in with an OpenAI API key, some functionality such as [cloud threads](https://developers.openai.com/codex/prompting#threads) might not be available.

3. Select a project

   Choose a project folder that you want Codex to work in.

If you used the Codex app, CLI, or IDE Extension before you'll see past projects that you worked on.

4. Send your first message

   After choosing the project, make sure **Local** is selected to have Codex work on your machine and send your first message to Codex.

   You can ask Codex anything about the project or your computer in general. Here are some examples:

- Tell me about this project
- Build a classic Snake game in this repo.
- Find and fix bugs in my codebase with minimal, high-confidence changes.
