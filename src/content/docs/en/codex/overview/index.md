Codex is OpenAI's coding agent for software development. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans include Codex. It can help you:

- **Write code**: Describe what you want to build, and Codex generates code that matches your intent, adapting to your existing project structure and conventions.

- **Understand unfamiliar codebases**: Codex can read and explain complex or legacy code, helping you grasp how teams organize systems.

- **Review code**: Codex analyzes code to identify potential bugs, logic errors, and unhandled edge cases.

- **Debug and fix problems**: When something breaks, Codex helps trace failures, diagnose root causes, and suggest targeted fixes.

- **Automate development tasks**: Codex can run repetitive workflows such as refactoring, testing, migrations, and setup tasks so you can focus on higher-level engineering work.
