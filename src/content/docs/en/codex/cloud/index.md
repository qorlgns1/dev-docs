# Codex web

Codex is OpenAI's coding agent that can read, edit, and run code. It helps you build faster, fix bugs, and understand unfamiliar code. With Codex cloud, Codex can work on tasks in the background (including in parallel) using its own cloud environment.

## Codex web setup

Go to [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) and connect your GitHub account. This lets Codex work with the code in your repositories and create pull requests from its work.

Your Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise plan includes Codex. Learn more about [what's included](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing). Some Enterprise workspaces may require [admin setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/enterprise/admin-setup) before you can access Codex.
