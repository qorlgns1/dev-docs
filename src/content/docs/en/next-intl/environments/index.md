# Environments

The `next-intl` APIs are available in the following environments:

[Server & Client Components→](https://next-intl.dev/docs/environments/server-client-components)[Server Actions, Metadata & Route Handlers→](https://next-intl.dev/docs/environments/actions-metadata-route-handlers)[Error files (e.g. not-found)→](https://next-intl.dev/docs/environments/error-files)[Testing→](https://next-intl.dev/docs/environments/testing)[Core library (agnostic)→](https://next-intl.dev/docs/environments/core-library)

While modern browsers and server runtimes typically support all necessary JavaScript APIs that are required for `next-intl`, you can double check the [runtime requirements](https://next-intl.dev/docs/environments/runtime-requirements).
