# Library | Playwright

## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright Library provides unified APIs for launching and interacting with browsers, while Playwright Test provides all this plus a fully managed end-to-end Test Runner and experience.

Under most circumstances, for end-to-end testing, you'll want to use `@playwright/test` (Playwright Test), and not `playwright` (Playwright Library) directly. To get started with Playwright Test, follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

## Differences when using library[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#differences-when-using-library "Direct link to Differences when using library")

### Library Example[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#library-example "Direct link to Library Example")

The following is an example of using the Playwright Library directly to launch Chromium, go to a page, and check its title:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

```
    import { chromium, devices } from 'playwright';
    import assert from 'node:assert';

    (async () => {
      // Setup
      const browser = await chromium.launch();
      const context = await browser.newContext(devices['iPhone 11']);
      const page = await context.newPage();

      // The actual interesting bit
      await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());
      await page.goto('https://example.com/');

      assert(await page.title() === 'Example Domain'); // 👎 not a Web First assertion

      // Teardown
      await context.close();
      await browser.close();
    })();

```

```
    const assert = require('node:assert');
    const { chromium, devices } = require('playwright');

    (async () => {
      // Setup
      const browser = await chromium.launch();
      const context = await browser.newContext(devices['iPhone 11']);
      const page = await context.newPage();

      // The actual interesting bit
      await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());
      await page.goto('https://example.com/');

      assert(await page.title() === 'Example Domain'); // 👎 not a Web First assertion

      // Teardown
      await context.close();
      await browser.close();
    })();

```

Run it with `node my-script.js`.

### Test Example[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#test-example "Direct link to Test Example")

A test to achieve similar behavior, would look like:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

```
    import { expect, test, devices } from '@playwright/test';

    test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);

    test('should be titled', async ({ page, context }) => {
      await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());
      await page.goto('https://example.com/');

      await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example');
    });

```

```
    const { expect, test, devices } = require('@playwright/test');

    test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);

    test('should be titled', async ({ page, context }) => {
      await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());
      await page.goto('https://example.com/');

      await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example');
    });

```

Run it with `npx playwright test`.

### Key Differences[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#key-differences "Direct link to Key Differences")

The key differences to note are as follows:

| Library| Test| Installation| `npm install playwright`| `npm init playwright@latest` \- note `install` vs. `init`| Install browsers| Install `@playwright/browser-chromium`, `@playwright/browser-firefox` and/or `@playwright/browser-webkit`| `npx playwright install` or `npx playwright install chromium` for a single one| `import` from| `playwright`| `@playwright/test`| Initialization| Explicitly need to:

1. Pick a browser to use, e.g. `chromium`
2. Launch browser with [browserType.launch()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch)
3. Create a context with [browser.newContext()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context), _and_ pass any context options explicitly, e.g. `devices['iPhone 11']`
4. Create a page with [browserContext.newPage()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-new-page)

| An isolated `page` and `context` are provided to each test out-of the box, along with other [built-in fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures). No explicit creation. If referenced by the test in its arguments, the Test Runner will create them for the test. (i.e. lazy-initialization)| Assertions| No built-in Web-First Assertions| [Web-First assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions) like:

- [expect(page).toHaveTitle()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-title)
- [expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1)

which auto-wait and retry for the condition to be met.| Timeouts| Defaults to 30s for most operations.| Most operations don't time out, but every test has a timeout that makes it fail (30s by default).| Cleanup| Explicitly need to:

1. Close context with [browserContext.close()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-close)
2. Close browser with [browser.close()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-close)

| No explicit close of [built-in fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures); the Test Runner will take care of it. | Running | When using the Library, you run the code as a node script, possibly with some compilation first. | When using the Test Runner, you use the `npx playwright test` command. Along with your [config](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration), the Test Runner handles any compilation and choosing what to run and how to run it. |

In addition to the above, Playwright Test, as a full-featured Test Runner, includes:

- [Configuration Matrix and Projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration): In the above example, in the Playwright Library version, if we wanted to run with a different device or browser, we'd have to modify the script and plumb the information through. With Playwright Test, we can just specify the [matrix of configurations](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) in one place, and it will create run the one test under each of these configurations.
- [Parallelization](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel)
- [Web-First Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions)
- [Reporting](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters)
- [Retries](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-retries)
- [Easily Enabled Tracing](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro)
- and more…

## Usage[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#usage "Direct link to Usage")

Use npm or Yarn to install Playwright library in your Node.js project. See [system requirements](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#system-requirements).

```
    npm i -D playwright

```

You will also need to install browsers - either manually or by adding a package that will do it for you automatically.

```
    # Download the Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browser
    npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit

    # Alternatively, add packages that will download a browser upon npm install
    npm i -D @playwright/browser-chromium @playwright/browser-firefox @playwright/browser-webkit

```

See [managing browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries) for more options.

Once installed, you can import Playwright in a Node.js script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (`chromium`, `firefox` and `webkit`).

```
    const { chromium } = require('playwright');

    (async () => {
      const browser = await chromium.launch();
      // Create pages, interact with UI elements, assert values
      await browser.close();
    })();

```

Playwright APIs are asynchronous and return Promise objects. Our code examples use [the async/await pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) to ease readability. The code is wrapped in an unnamed async arrow function which is invoking itself.

```
    (async () => { // Start of async arrow function
      // Function code
      // ...
    })(); // End of the function and () to invoke itself

```

## First script[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#first-script "Direct link to First script")

In our first script, we will navigate to `https://playwright.dev/` and take a screenshot in WebKit.

```
    const { webkit } = require('playwright');

    (async () => {
      const browser = await webkit.launch();
      const page = await browser.newPage();
      await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
      await page.screenshot({ path: `example.png` });
      await browser.close();
    })();

```

By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the `headless: false` flag while launching the browser. You can also use `slowMo` to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools [section](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug).

```
    firefox.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 50 });

```

## Record scripts[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#record-scripts "Direct link to Record scripts")

[Command line tools](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) can be used to record user interactions and generate JavaScript code.

```
    npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org

```

## Browser downloads[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#browser-downloads "Direct link to Browser downloads")

To download Playwright browsers run:

```
    # Explicitly download browsers
    npx playwright install

```

Alternatively, you can add `@playwright/browser-chromium`, `@playwright/browser-firefox` and `@playwright/browser-webkit` packages to automatically download the respective browser during the package installation.

```
    # Use a helper package that downloads a browser on npm install
    npm install @playwright/browser-chromium

```

**Download behind a firewall or a proxy**

Pass `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to download through a proxy.

- Bash
- PowerShell
- Batch

```
    # Manual
    HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install

    # Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npm install

```

```
    # Manual
    $Env:HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
    npx playwright install

    # Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    $Env:HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
    npm install

```

```
    # Manual
    set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
    npx playwright install

    # Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
    npm install

```

**Download from artifact repository**

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN. Pass `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` environment variable to download from an internal artifacts repository instead.

- Bash
- PowerShell
- Batch

```
    # Manual
    PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npx playwright install

    # Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npm install

```

```
    # Manual
    $Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
    npx playwright install

    # Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    $Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
    npm install

```

```
    # Manual
    set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
    npx playwright install

    # Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
    npm install

```

**Skip browser download**

In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because browser binaries are managed separately. This can be done by setting `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` variable before installing packages.

- Bash
- PowerShell
- Batch

```
    # When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install

```

```
    # When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    $Env:PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
    npm install

```

```
    # When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
    # and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
    set PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
    npm install

```

## TypeScript support[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#typescript-support "Direct link to TypeScript support")

Playwright includes built-in support for TypeScript. Type definitions will be imported automatically. It is recommended to use type-checking to improve the IDE experience.

### In JavaScript[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#in-javascript "Direct link to In JavaScript")

Add the following to the top of your JavaScript file to get type-checking in VS Code or WebStorm.

```
    // @ts-check
    // ...

```

Alternatively, you can use JSDoc to set types for variables.

```
    /** @type {import('playwright').Page} */
    let page;

```

### In TypeScript[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#in-typescript "Direct link to In TypeScript")

TypeScript support will work out-of-the-box. Types can also be imported explicitly.

```
    let page: import('playwright').Page;

```
