# Touchscreen | Playwright

The Touchscreen class operates in main-frame CSS pixels relative to the top-left corner of the viewport. Methods on the touchscreen can only be used in browser contexts that have been initialized with `hasTouch` set to true.

This class is limited to emulating tap gestures. For examples of other gestures simulated by manually dispatching touch events, see the [emulating legacy touch events](https://playwright.dev/docs/touch-events) page.
