# field-sizing - Interactivity - Tailwind CSS

| Class                  | Styles                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `field-sizing-fixed`   | `field-sizing: fixed;`   |
| `field-sizing-content` | `field-sizing: content;` |

## Examples

- Sizing based on content

Use the `field-sizing-content` utility to allow a form control to adjust its size based on the content:

Type in the input below to see the size change

Latex Salesman, Vanderlay Industries

```
    <textarea class="field-sizing-content ..." rows="2">  Latex Salesman, Vanderlay Industries</textarea>
```

- Using a fixed size

Use the `field-sizing-fixed` utility to make a form control use a fixed size:

Type in the input below to see the size remain the same

Latex Salesman, Vanderlay Industries

```
    <textarea class="field-sizing-fixed w-80 ..." rows="2">  Latex Salesman, Vanderlay Industries</textarea>
```

- Responsive design

Prefix a `field-sizing` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
    <input class="field-sizing-content md:field-sizing-fixed ..." />
```
