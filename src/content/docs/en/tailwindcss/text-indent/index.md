## Examples

- Basic example

Use `indent-<number>` utilities like `indent-2` and `indent-8` to set the amount of empty space (indentation) that's shown before text in a block:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

```
    <p class="indent-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

- Using negative values

To use a negative text indent value, prefix the class name with a dash to convert it to a negative value:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

```
    <p class="-indent-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

- Using a custom value

Use the `indent-[<value>]` syntax to set the text indentation based on a completely custom value:

```
    <p class="indent-[50%] ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```

For CSS variables, you can also use the `indent-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

```
    <p class="indent-(--my-indentation) ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```

This is just a shorthand for `indent-[var(<custom-property>)]` that adds the `var()` function for you automatically.

- Responsive design

Prefix a `text-indent` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
    <p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
