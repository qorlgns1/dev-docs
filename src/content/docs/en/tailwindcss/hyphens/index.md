# hyphens - Typography - Tailwind CSS

| Class            | Styles             |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `hyphens-none`   | `hyphens: none;`   |
| `hyphens-manual` | `hyphens: manual;` |
| `hyphens-auto`   | `hyphens: auto;`   |

## Examples

- Preventing hyphenation

Use the `hyphens-none` utility to prevent words from being hyphenated even if the line break suggestion `&shy;` is used:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeug­haftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

```
    <p class="hyphens-none">  ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>
```

- Manual hyphenation

Use the `hyphens-manual` utility to only set hyphenation points where the line break suggestion `&shy;` is used:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeug­haftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

```
    <p class="hyphens-manual">  ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>
```

This is the default browser behavior.

- Automatic hyphenation

Use the `hyphens-auto` utility to allow the browser to automatically choose hyphenation points based on the language:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

```
    <p class="hyphens-auto" lang="de">  ... Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>
```

The line break suggestion `&shy;` will be preferred over automatic hyphenation points.

- Responsive design

Prefix a `hyphens` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
    <p class="hyphens-none md:hyphens-auto ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```
