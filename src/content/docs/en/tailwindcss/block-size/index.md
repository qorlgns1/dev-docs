## Examples

- Basic example

Use `block-<number>` utilities like `block-24` and `block-64` to set an element to a fixed block size based on the spacing scale:

block-96

block-80

block-64

block-48

block-40

block-32

block-24

```
    <div class="block-96 ...">block-96</div><div class="block-80 ...">block-80</div><div class="block-64 ...">block-64</div><div class="block-48 ...">block-48</div><div class="block-40 ...">block-40</div><div class="block-32 ...">block-32</div><div class="block-24 ...">block-24</div>
```

- Using a percentage

Use `block-full` or `block-<fraction>` utilities like `block-1/2` and `block-2/5` to give an element a percentage-based block size:

block-full

block-9/10

block-3/4

block-1/2

block-1/3

```
    <div class="block-full ...">block-full</div><div class="block-9/10 ...">block-9/10</div><div class="block-3/4 ...">block-3/4</div><div class="block-1/2 ...">block-1/2</div><div class="block-1/3 ...">block-1/3</div>
```

- Matching viewport

Use the `block-screen` utility to make an element span the entire block size of the viewport:

```
    <div class="block-screen">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

- Matching dynamic viewport

Use the `block-dvh` utility to make an element span the entire block size of the viewport, which changes as the browser UI expands or contracts:

```
    <div class="block-dvh">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

- Matching large viewport

Use the `block-lvh` utility to set an element's block size to the largest possible size of the viewport:

```
    <div class="block-lvh">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

- Matching small viewport

Use the `block-svh` utility to set an element's block size to the smallest possible size of the viewport:

```
    <div class="block-svh">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

- Using a custom value

Use the `block-[<value>]` syntax to set the block size based on a completely custom value:

```
    <div class="block-[32rem] ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

For CSS variables, you can also use the `block-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

```
    <div class="block-(--my-block-size) ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

This is just a shorthand for `block-[var(<custom-property>)]` that adds the `var()` function for you automatically.

- Responsive design

Prefix a `block-size` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
    <div class="block-1/2 md:block-full ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).

## Customizing your theme

The `block-<number>` utilities are driven by the `--spacing` theme variable, which can be customized in your own theme:

```
    @theme {  --spacing: 1px; }
```

Learn more about customizing the spacing scale in the [theme variable documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).
