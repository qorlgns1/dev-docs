# list-style-position - Typography - Tailwind CSS

| Class          | Styles                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `list-inside`  | `list-style-position: inside;`  |
| `list-outside` | `list-style-position: outside;` |

## Examples

- Basic example

Use utilities like `list-inside` and `list-outside` to control the position of the markers and text indentation in a list:

list-inside

- 5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 3lb of celery

list-outside

- 5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 3lb of celery

```
    <ul class="list-inside">  <li>5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms</li>  <!-- ... --></ul><ul class="list-outside">  <li>5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms</li>  <!-- ... --></ul>
```

- Responsive design

Prefix a `list-style-position` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```
    <ul class="list-outside md:list-inside ...">  <!-- ... --></ul>
```
