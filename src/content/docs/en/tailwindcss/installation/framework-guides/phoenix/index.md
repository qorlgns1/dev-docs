# Install Tailwind CSS with Phoenix - Tailwind CSS

01

#### Create your project

Start by creating a new Phoenix project if you don't have one set up already. You can follow their [installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) to get up and running.

Terminal

```
    mix phx.new myprojectcd myproject
```

02

#### Install the Tailwind plugin

Add the Tailwind plugin to your dependencies and run `mix deps.get` to install it.

mix.exs

```
    defp deps do  [    # …    {:tailwind, "~> 0.3", runtime: Mix.env() == :dev},  ]end
```

03

#### Configure the Tailwind plugin

In your `config/config.exs` file you can set which version of Tailwind CSS you want to use and customize your asset paths.

config.exs

```
    config :tailwind,  version: "4.1.10",  myproject: [    args: ~w(      --input=assets/css/app.css      --output=priv/static/assets/app.css    ),    cd: Path.expand("..", __DIR__)  ]
```

04

#### Update your deployment script

Configure your `assets.deploy` alias to build your CSS on deployment.

mix.exs

```
    defp aliases do  [    # …    "assets.deploy": [      "tailwind myproject --minify",      "esbuild myproject --minify",      "phx.digest"    ]  ]end
```

05

#### Enable watcher in development

Add Tailwind to your list of watchers in your `./config/dev.exs` file.

dev.exs

```
    watchers: [  # Start the esbuild watcher by calling Esbuild.install_and_run(:default, args)  esbuild: {Esbuild, :install_and_run, [:myproject, ~w(--sourcemap=inline --watch)]},  tailwind: {Tailwind, :install_and_run, [:myproject, ~w(--watch)]}]
```

06

#### Install Tailwind CSS

Run the install command to download the standalone Tailwind CLI.

Terminal

```
    mix tailwind.install
```

07

#### Import Tailwind CSS

Add an `@import` to `./assets/css/app.css` that imports Tailwind CSS.

app.css

```
    @import "tailwindcss";
```

08

#### Remove the default CSS import

Remove the CSS import from `./assets/js/app.js`, as Tailwind is now handling this for you.

app.js

```
    // Remove this line if you add your own CSS build pipeline (e.g postcss).import "../css/app.css"
```

09

#### Start your build process

Run your build process with `mix phx.server`.

Terminal

```
    mix phx.server
```

10

#### Start using Tailwind in your project

Start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

index.html.heex

```
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">  Hello world!</h1>
```
