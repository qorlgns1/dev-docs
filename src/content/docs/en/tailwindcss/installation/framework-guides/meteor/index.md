# Install Tailwind CSS with Meteor - Tailwind CSS

01

#### Create your project

Start by creating a new Meteor project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use [the Meteor CLI](https://docs.meteor.com/about/install.html).

Terminal

```
    npx meteor create my-projectcd my-project
```

02

#### Install Tailwind CSS

Install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and its peer dependencies via npm.

Terminal

```
    npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss postcss-load-config
```

03

#### Configure PostCSS Plugins

Create a `postcss.config.mjs` file in the root of your project and add the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin to your PostCSS configuration.

postcss.config.mjs

```
    export default {  plugins: {    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},  },};
```

04

#### Import Tailwind CSS

Add an `@import` for Tailwind CSS to your `./client/main.css` file.

main.css

```
    @import "tailwindcss";
```

05

#### Start your build process

Run your build process with `npm run start`.

Terminal

```
    npm run start
```

06

#### Start using Tailwind in your project

Start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

App.jsx

```
    export const App = () => (  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">    Hello world!  </h1>)
```
