# Troubleshooting | Sentry for Next.js

Why aren't recurring job errors showing up on my monitor details page?

You may not have [linked errors to your monitor](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/crons.md#connecting-errors-to-cron-monitors).

Why am I not receiving alerts when my monitor fails?

You may not have [set up alerts for your monitor](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/crons.md#alerts).

What is the crons data retention policy for check-ins?

Our current data retention policy is 90 days.

Do you support a monitor schedule with a six-field crontab expression?

Currently, we only support crontab expressions with five fields.
